# Diabetes-Assistant
Our goal is to help diabetes patients to remind them about their mealtime, medicine time and also insulin taking time. Our aim was to design a patient-friendly assistant application for the diabetes patient. It is basically an application that helps diabetes patient to remember their medicine because we know, diabetes patients sometimes forget their medicine, meal, sleeping and wake up timing. That is why we decided to make an application that will help diabetes patients to remind these things. We took face to face interview of 10 diabetes patients and collected some data for our project.
Our main goal is to help Diabetes patient to remember everything like an assistant to help them to eat, sleep and take their medicine/insulin timely. Also, trace their diabetes & record the updates for future references.
